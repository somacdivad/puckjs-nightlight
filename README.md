# puckjs-nightlight
A color changing night light for Puck.js.

## About this project
I wanted to make something fun for my 9-year-old daughter with my Puck.js and had the idea for a color changing night light that she could turn on and off easily. Pressing the Puck.js button turns the night light on. When activated, the Puck lights up and slowly changes color. Pressing the button again turns off the night light. Each time the night light is activated, the starting color, color sequence and fade times are randomized. We found that the night light looks best when the silicon cover is removed and set on top of the Puck to allow greater diffusion of the LEDs.

## Installation
In order to work properly, this project requires a Puck.js. No external libraries are used, so uploading the file via Web Bluetooth or the Espruino Web IDE will both work just fine.
